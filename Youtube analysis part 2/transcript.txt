0:19
Hear that?
0:21
That's nothing.
0:24
Which is what I, as a speaker at today's conference,
0:28
have for you all.
0:30
I have nothing.
0:32
Nada.
0:33
Zip.
0:34
Zilch.
0:36
Zippo.
0:37
Nothing smart. Nothing inspirational.
0:40
Nothing even remotely researched at all.
0:43
I have absolutely nothing to say whatsoever.
0:47
And yet, through my manner of speaking, I will make it seem like I do.
0:53
Like what I am saying is brilliant.
0:55
And maybe, just maybe, you will feel like you've learned something.
1:02
Now, I'm going to get started with the opening.
1:04
I'm going to make a lot of hand gestures.
1:06
I'm going to do this with my right hand, I'm going to do this with my left.
1:10
I'm going to adjust my glasses.
1:11
And then I'm going to ask you all a question.
1:13
By a show of hands, how many of you all have been asked a question before?
1:17
(Laughter)
1:18
Okay, great, I'm seeing some hands.
1:20
And again, I have nothing here.
1:23
Now, I'm gonna react to that
1:24
and act like I'm telling you a personal anecdote.
1:27
Something to break the tension.
1:30
Something to endear myself a little bit.
1:32
Something kind of embarrassing.
1:38
And you guys are going to make an "aw" sound.
1:41
It's true. It really happened.
1:44
(Laughter)
1:45
And now I'm going to bring it to a broader point.
1:47
I'm going to really beckon.
1:50
I'm going to make it intellectual.
1:52
I'm going to bring it to this man right here.
1:55
Now, what this man did was important, I'm sure.
1:59
(Laughter)
2:01
But I, for one, have no idea who he is.
2:04
I simply googled image the word "Scientist."
2:07
(Laughter)
2:08
And now you see, I'd like it to seem like I'm making points,
2:11
building an argument,
2:13
inspiring you to change your life, when in reality,
2:16
this is just
2:17
me...
2:19
buying...
2:20
time...
2:20
Now, if you don't believe me, let's take a look at the numbers.
2:23
This is a real thing that's happening right now.
2:26
The number of talks that I'm giving is one.
2:30
Interesting facts imparted thus far in said talk,
2:32
well, that's going to be a zero.
2:34
My height in inches is 70.5. Note the .5 there.
2:39
2x6 equals 12.
2:41
And then interestingly enough 6x2 also equals 12.
2:43
That's math.
2:46
352 is a three-digit number
2:50
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then almost immediately following that we get 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
2:56
Now, to add more filler here,
2:57
I'm going to give you a couple more number to consider,
3:00
uh ... 18.
3:02
237.
3:03
5,601.
3:06
2.6 million.
3:08
Four.
3:10
Four.
3:11
24. Staggering!
3:14
(Laughter)
3:15
These are real numbers, all of them.
3:17
And to follow that up, let's take a look at some graphs.
3:20
Now, if you take a look at this pie chart, what you're going to see
3:23
is that the majority far exceeds the minority.
3:26
Everybody see that? Cool, isn't it?
3:29
And let's take a look at this bar graph,
3:31
'cause it shows similarly irrelevant data.
3:34
Now, I'm doing this because I'd like to make it seem
3:37
like I've done my homework.
3:39
If you were, say, watching this on YouTube with the sound off,
3:42
you might think, "Ah, okay. This guy knows what he's talking about."
3:47
But I don't.
3:48
I'm floundering, panicking. I've got nothing.
3:51
I'm a total and utter phony.
3:53
But you know what?
3:55
I was offered a TED Talk.
3:57
And dammit, I'm gonna see it through.
3:59
(Laughter)
4:01
Now, if you take a look behind me,
4:03
these are just words paired with vaguely thought-provoking stock photos.
4:08
I'm going to point at them
4:09
like I'm making use both of my time as well as your time.
4:12
But in reality, I don't know what half of them mean.
4:15
And now, as these continue, I'm just going to start saying gibberish.
4:19
Wagga wah, gabba gabba.
4:21
Turkey, mouth and a mouth.
4:24
Chip, trip, my dog Skip.
4:27
Rip it and dip it, Richard.
4:29
I'm an itty-bitty baby bopper.
4:31
And I'm hungry in my tum tum.
4:33
Brad Pitt, Uma Thurman.
4:36
Names, things.
4:37
Words, words and more things.
4:39
And see? It feels like it might make sense, doesn't it?
4:43
Like maybe, just maybe,
4:44
I'm building to some sort of satisfying conclusion,
4:47
I mean, I'm gesticulating as though I am.
4:49
I'm pacing, I'm growing in intensity,
4:51
I'm taking off my glasses, which by the way, are just frames.
4:54
(Laughter)
4:59
I wore them to look smart,
5:02
even though my vision is perfect.
5:07
And now I'm going to slow things down a little bit.
5:10
I'm going to change the tone.
5:13
I'm going to make it seem like I'm building to a moment.
5:20
And what if I was?
5:22
(Laughter)
5:24
Amazing, isn't it? What can we do?
5:26
Life's a roller coaster.
5:32
You know, if there's one thing you'd take away from my talk,
5:35
I'd like you to think about what you heard at the beginning,
5:38
and I'd like you to think about what you hear now.
5:42
Because it was nothing
5:44
and it's still nothing, think about that.
5:47
Or don't, that's fine.
5:49
And now I'm going to stop talking.
5:52
Thank you.
5:53
(Applause)
