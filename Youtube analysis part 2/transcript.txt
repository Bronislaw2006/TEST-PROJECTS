The world today,
0:05
it's no longer news that we are grappling
0:08
with the devastating effects of climate change.
0:11
Communities are searching for solutions,
0:14
trying to turn the tide onto the future that at times really looks so depressing.
0:20
And there is no place this is more real than in the continent of Africa.
0:25
But of course,
0:27
conversations about climate change
0:30
often miss out on accounting for the most critical barrier
0:36
to climate solution,
0:37
which is conflict.
0:40
I got to know about this through my personal experience
0:43
as a survivor of war,
0:45
but also working with a population
0:48
that has been living through conflicts for years.
0:52
If you may, I would love to share with you a story
0:55
based on my personal encounter with the communities that I work with
0:59
and who are going through the difficult times of climate change.
1:03
I'm from Uganda.
1:06
Recently, in my home district of Lira,
1:10
a woman was arrested
1:12
because she had cut the shea trees
1:14
and burned the charcoal into fuel.
1:17
And it's a crime in Uganda.
1:20
I saw her being walked to the police station,
1:23
and I decided to ask her,
1:25
said, “My sister, I see you are being taken,
1:27
and you'll be charged for this crime.
1:29
But I have a question for you.
1:31
If you were forgiven for this crime today,
1:34
do you promise that you will never do it again?"
1:40
The frustrated woman looked at me
1:43
and told me and said, "You know what?
1:45
Even if they release me right now, I would do it again.
1:50
I would do it again, because only through burning charcoal
1:52
that I can raise money to pay for my children's education.
1:57
And it's only through burning charcoal that I can raise money
2:00
to meet the medical bills for my children, who are always falling sick of malaria.
2:04
So the truth is, I would do it again."
2:08
This is the story for many in Uganda.
2:11
Beautiful country with so much potential,
2:14
but always undermined
2:17
by a near constant state of violent conflict.
2:20
And you know,
2:22
in a community where poverty and unemployment is so high,
2:27
fighting against climate change is almost a losing battle.
2:33
But when you look through across Africa,
2:36
you find that most of the countries most vulnerable to climate crisis
2:40
are going through some sort of conflict.
2:43
When you look through the Sahel region,
2:45
you find there's always constant attack,
2:50
clashes between the herding,
2:52
the farming and the fishing communities
2:55
over diminishing land and water resources.
3:00
Of course, with not so much option,
3:03
humanity will always do anything possible for survival.
3:07
I remember this firsthand when I was growing up as a child
3:11
in war zone in northern Uganda.
3:14
I myself had to cut the trees, to burn charcoal,
3:18
to raise money to meet the basic needs,
3:21
but most importantly, to pay for my education.
3:24
An education that has enabled me
3:27
to be able to stand before you to give this speech today.
3:31
Now the big question is:
3:35
How can we make it,
3:36
what can we do to create an alternative to environmental destruction
3:41
and provide economic means
3:44
that will support conditions necessary for peace?
3:47
That's the biggest question we should be asking ourselves today.
3:50
I remember, I think about this a lot
3:53
through my work at African Youth Initiative Network, AYINET,
3:56
where for decades we have been supporting war survivors from Uganda,
4:01
from Congo, from Sudan and South Sudan,
4:04
and we've been able to mobilize young people
4:07
to make them game changers for peace and development.
4:10
We mediate in community conflicts
4:13
and support agricultural activities
4:16
as a mechanism to provide youth economic alternatives to violence.
4:22
And we have been successful.
4:24
So the success of this work we have done is a clear manifestation
4:28
of how a local initiative
4:31
can greatly impact on economic empowerment,
4:35
on conflict resolution and on climate change.
4:39
And every time I think about this,
4:41
I do believe this is an opportunity for Africa
4:44
to also impact on world peace.
4:46
And I sincerely know for sure that for us to achieve this goal,
4:52
the following three points have always come very strongly in my heart.
4:56
And the first is we need to change the way
4:59
we're talking about climate change.
5:02
It is time that we take the climate dialogue
5:05
beyond just mere weather patterns
5:08
and help people understand what they are fighting for,
5:12
who they are protecting,
5:14
what will they win or lose based on their action or inactions.
5:18
This has always helped us.
5:20
I remember early last year
5:23
I went to my village with my twin brother, Jack.
5:26
We were welcomed by one of the community elders, Charles.
5:30
He was so happy to see us, to welcome us home,
5:32
and he was sad that he couldn't give us some sugar cane,
5:36
which used to be his traditional gift to us,
5:39
simply because the wetland that used to grow sugar cane had dried up,
5:44
and he was really sad about it.
5:46
My twin brother comforted him and told him,
5:48
“Weather is changing, weather would encourage us,
5:51
let community do our part by planting trees
5:54
so that we can attract more rain."
5:55
When he heard this, he asked my brother, said, “Mr. Opio,
5:59
are you saying, as you are saying, trees is good to bring rain?
6:05
Now that you have planted so many trees in your community,
6:10
is it raining in your garden?"
6:12
To me, this was sincerely the most basic,
6:14
important organic question that could come from this community.
6:18
But also it made me reflect if, if at all,
6:20
our global discussions about climate change
6:22
is actually responding to the needs at the grassroots.
6:27
So, today,
6:31
in northern Uganda,
6:34
shea trees are no longer producing enough fruits
6:38
because there's local knowledge
6:40
that shea trees do need bush burning
6:44
in order to stimulate flowering.
6:47
But also, we know bush burning is bad for environment,
6:50
creating a lot of confusion.
6:52
And this brings in the issue that contradictory accounts from experts,
6:58
from activists, from the government,
7:01
which leaves the local communities
7:03
as collateral victims of global disagreement.
7:06
And this has kept every one of us
7:09
in the merry-go-round of climate confusion.
7:13
Secondly ...
7:17
We need to engage the population that is most affected,
7:20
in this case, the young people, the youth.
7:23
With 70 percent of Africa below the age of 30,
7:27
youth represent the largest demographic opportunity for the continent.
7:31
We have to engage, including youth,
7:34
to be an opportunity to uplift the continent
7:36
from the devastating poverty.
7:38
And excluding young people in all the climate activities
7:42
will benefit conflict.
7:44
So we must engage young people.
7:47
This is because we do know youth are the legitimate owners of the future,
7:50
so their inclusion is mandatory.
7:53
And finally,
7:56
as we seek to mitigate the effects of climate change and conflict,
8:01
it is time to hold corporations,
8:03
government and individuals accountable
8:06
for committing climate crimes at home and abroad.
8:10
This should be done by establishing International Climate Court.
8:15
Today, the world is celebrating the transition to clean energy.
8:20
We are celebrating the progress.
8:22
But we cannot celebrate the transition to clean energy
8:24
while being silent about the death and suffering of millions of people.
8:30
In Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance,
8:33
populations have been displaced,
8:35
millions have been killed,
8:37
lost properties,
8:38
just because companies or corporations
8:41
are exploiting their natural resources.
8:44
And we have seen also rebel groups fighting to take on the fertile lands,
8:50
lands rich with minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
8:54
The truth is, the suffering, the death,
8:58
the inhumanity we are seeing in Congo
9:00
is a proof that the road to clean energy
9:05
is so far the dirtiest road on the planet.
9:10
Of course, I'm also worried.
9:13
I'm worried that the climate crisis will leave the world more divided,
9:17
especially between the global North and the global South.
9:21
I'm also worried that the rich and the poor will be divided.
9:25
The rural and urban.
9:27
Why?
9:28
Because 10 percent of the world's wealthiest
9:31
are discussing a reduction of global emissions by flying less.
9:37
And yet, greater, poorer majority
9:40
are dreaming for only the one-time opportunity to fly.
9:44
And to them,
9:45
all these climate regulations being proposed
9:50
appear as an effort to reinforce the pre-existing inequality,
9:54
which has always been meant to keep them poor.
9:57
This is going to create the division.
10:00
Lastly,
10:01
there is an African proverb
10:05
by legendary South African musician, Lucky Dube,
10:09
who sang the song that says:
10:13
"The night is long for a hungry child."
10:18
"The night is long for a hungry child."
10:21
What an image.
10:23
That child could have been your child.
10:26
Think about that mom,
10:29
that dad, who are powerlessly waiting for the morning,
10:35
to try to get something for the child who can't sleep
10:39
because he went to bed with empty stomach.
10:42
If we have opportunity, we should have leadership
10:44
that are willing to create conditions
10:47
that will help build the community of tomorrow
10:50
that our children can count on.
10:53
And lastly, may we realize that the birth of a new era
10:57
would mean we must all understand that climate change and war
11:03
are intertwined global long-term challenges.
11:07
It will require all of us to work together and, most importantly,
11:12
mobilize a generation that is so willing to defy violence
11:16
and work for the good of all of us.
11:18
Apwoyo matek. Thank you very much.
11:21
(Applause)
