Intro
0:08
For the past 15 years,
0:09
I have been obsessed with the amount of food we waste.
0:13
This makes me like the last person anyone wants to have dinner with.
0:16
(Laughter)
0:18
Inevitably, we're sitting there at the end of the meal,
0:20
they’re pushing food around their plate they don’t want to eat,
0:23
and they're looking at me with some awkward excuse.
How big is food waste
0:27
And I say, look, we can't eat our way out of this.
0:30
This is a systems problem, and it's just way too big.
0:35
How big?
0:36
Well, picture a farm.
0:38
It's the size of the entire United States.
0:41
It uses three times as much water as the whole country,
0:45
and it grows food all year long, and when harvested,
0:48
produces enough to fill 100 tractor trailers every minute all year long.
0:53
Those trucks then drive, fly, and float all over the world.
0:56
Except instead of going somewhere to be eaten,
0:59
they go straight to a landfill
1:01
where the food rots and produces methane,
1:03
a powerful greenhouse gas.
1:05
Seems crazy, right?
1:06
But that's effectively what we're doing.
1:08
From science experiments in the back of our refrigerators
1:11
to truckloads of products
1:13
that are too close to some arbitrary expiration date,
1:16
globally, one billion meals go uneaten every single day.
1:22
That's more than a meal per person
1:24
for everyone on this planet who faces hunger.
1:27
Not to mention it's worth one trillion dollars.
1:31
And this whole ridiculous exercise
1:33
has five times the greenhouse gas footprint of the entire aviation industry.
Why is food waste so big
1:38
Now, I know it's not obvious
1:40
why food waste would have such a big climate impact,
1:42
so let me explain.
1:44
First, landfills.
1:45
Landfills are the third-largest source of methane in the US,
1:49
and almost 60 percent of that methane is coming from food rotting.
1:54
And as big as that is,
1:55
it's dwarfed by the huge amount of energy
1:59
and resources it takes to grow,
2:02
harvest, transport, cool, cook food
2:04
and get it to our tables.
2:06
And there's an even larger reason.
2:09
And that's land use.
2:11
We are looking ahead at a future in 2050
2:14
where it's projected we'll need about 50 percent more food
2:16
than we had in 2010.
2:18
And the question is, where is that food going to come from?
2:21
Are we going to cut down more rainforests to grow it,
2:23
or are we going to use the food that we already have?
2:26
Researchers estimate about 20 percent of that gap
2:30
could be met by simply wasting less.
2:33
When I first came across these numbers,
2:36
I thought to myself, gosh, this is the dumbest problem.
2:39
(Laughter)
2:41
And I wanted to know why.
2:43
And it turns out, there are all sorts of reasons
2:45
that are very different for a strawberry farm in California
2:48
than a market in Africa.
2:50
But to give you a sense, here are a few.
Why we dont measure food waste
2:52
One is we don't measure it, so it's invisible.
2:57
And as we all know, you don't manage what you don't measure.
3:00
Also, in some places, food is relatively cheap
3:03
and the fees to throw it away are even cheaper.
3:06
In other places,
3:08
there's simply not the infrastructure to keep food cold.
3:12
At times, we're worried about running out
3:14
because God forbid I don't have enough stuffed mushrooms for everyone.
3:18
And then at other times, we're worried about it making us sick.
3:21
When in doubt, throw it out, right?
3:24
And then there's my seven-year-old son
3:26
who begs me for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the morning
3:29
and comes home in the afternoon with his lunchbox completely untouched.
3:34
And when I ask him what he ate for lunch, he says,
3:36
"Oh, I just talked."
3:38
Now, I don't know what you do about that one.
3:40
(Laughter)
3:42
But overall, fixing food waste is not rocket science.
3:46
It’s really just about managing our food better, and it’s solvable.
3:49
There's a lot we can do in our own lives, and I'll get to that in a bit.
3:53
And there is a lot we can do across the food supply chain.
Solutions to food waste
3:57
At ReFED, the organization where I work,
4:00
that is entirely dedicated to reducing the amount of food we waste,
4:04
we have identified over 80 solutions that can help.
4:08
Many of them are about prevention,
4:11
about making sure that extra food does not occur in the first place,
4:15
which is really our priority
4:16
because prevention gives you the most bang for your buck,
4:19
both environmentally and financially.
4:22
After that, we look at donating food.
4:24
And, only when that’s been exhausted, at feeding it to animals, composting it,
4:29
or other recycling methods.
4:31
There are so many successful examples out there of these solutions.
4:36
One is a Nigerian company called ColdHubs.
4:39
They build solar-powered cold rooms in markets and farms.
4:44
And in places that don't have electricity
4:46
this extends shelf life dramatically,
4:48
giving farmers more time to sell their product
4:50
and therefore the ability to fetch a better price.
4:53
They have saved thousands of tons of food so far,
4:56
all while increasing farmer incomes by 60 percent.
5:00
Another is Too Good To Go.
5:02
It's an app that restaurants and grocery stores can use
5:06
to discount product at the last minute,
5:08
before they might otherwise throw it out.
5:10
Businesses, they get extra revenue,
5:13
customers score a deal,
5:15
and it has spread like wildfire.
5:17
Now in 17 countries,
5:19
they saved over 100 million meals last year alone.
5:23
From a different angle, there's Compass Group.
5:26
It's the largest food service company in the world,
5:28
and they are busy trying a lot of unsexy things like tracking their waste,
5:34
experimenting with smaller containers on buffets
5:37
or offering different sized portions so that there's a smaller option
5:41
if you, say, don't want a massive burrito.
5:44
They've had a lot of success across the world,
5:47
even decreasing waste up to 50 percent in some of their largest sites.
Sustainable Development Goal
5:52
These are just a few of the many solutions
5:54
that are being tried and tested.
5:56
Some are high-tech, some are low,
5:58
many are win-win -- and they’re starting to work.
6:01
But it’s not enough, and it’s not fast enough.
6:05
Countries and companies from around the world
6:08
have signed on to the UN Sustainable Development Goal
6:10
to cut food loss and waste in half by 2030.
6:14
The impact of this goal would be enormous.
6:18
It could avoid converting an area of land the size of Argentina into agriculture,
6:24
saving one-third of the biodiversity that we’re projected to lose
6:28
and avoiding as many emissions
6:30
as taking every single car in the US and Canada off the road would.
6:34
Yet, despite that incredible potential
6:36
and some beacons of progress,
6:38
overall, we are barely moving the needle.
6:41
And unlike the energy and transportation sectors,
6:46
attention and investment into food waste have been completely incommensurate
6:50
with the opportunity it presents.
Solutions
6:53
There are so many solutions that are working out there.
6:56
Let's inject the funds to really scale them.
7:00
ColdHubs has been quite successful across Nigeria,
7:02
but we need that solution in every market without electricity in every country.
7:07
Waste tracking, last-minute sale apps
7:09
and other technologies are demonstrating they work.
7:11
Let's provide incentives
7:13
so that every food business has those at their fingertips.
7:17
And we need investment to spark new innovation as well.
7:20
At ReFED, we estimate that for the US alone,
7:23
it could take 18 billion dollars to fully scale solutions.
7:28
A large investment.
7:29
But when you are throwing hundreds of billions of food away,
7:34
it actually can have a four-to-one return on that investment.
7:38
And other incredible benefits,
7:40
like providing four billion additional meals in food donations,
7:45
creating 60,000 jobs,
7:47
and huge water and greenhouse gas savings.
7:50
And because so much of the action needs to happen across the food supply chain,
7:53
we need food businesses to engage and prioritize this work.
7:57
They can be doubling down on streamlining their operations
8:02
and adopting new solutions as well.
8:04
We also need policy.
8:06
Ecuador, Japan, France and 10 states across the US
8:10
are just some of the places that have laws
8:13
that restrict food from going to landfills.
8:15
Instead, they provide infrastructure for composting
8:19
or other recycling methods,
8:22
and that compost then goes on to improve soils
8:25
and even sequester carbon, potentially.
What not to do
8:28
In addition, in some of those places,
8:31
they're seeing an increase in food donations
8:33
and even closer tracking of waste.
8:36
These laws should be everywhere.
8:39
And then there's us.
8:41
One of my favorite bumper stickers says:
8:43
"Hate traffic?
8:44
You are traffic."
8:46
(Laughter)
8:48
Well, we as consumers,
8:49
are actually the largest source of food going to waste.
8:52
More than grocery stores, farms or restaurants.
8:56
And in the US, as a culture,
8:59
we have also become really numb to it.
9:02
You know, I could walk down the street and throw half a sandwich on a sidewalk
9:05
and people would think I was crazy.
9:07
But if I throw that same half sandwich in a garbage can,
9:10
they wouldn't think much of it.
9:11
We need to be less accepting as a culture of wasting food,
9:16
and we need to take steps in our own lives as well.
9:19
But before I get to that, let me tell you what not to do.
9:23
You are going to go out into the world now,
9:25
and you are going to see food being wasted everywhere.
9:28
(Laughter)
9:29
And you're going to want to, well, eat it.
9:32
(Laughter)
9:33
This is not what we're going for, people.
9:36
Trust me, I have tried.
9:38
And I don’t think it’s what you’re going for either.
9:41
Instead, here are five tips that you can try
9:45
to manage your food better in your own lives.
9:48
First, shopping.
9:49
Shopping is really where we commit to food,
9:51
and so we need to be careful not to overbuy.
9:53
Old-school things like shopping lists and meal planning really help.
9:58
And let me be clear, frozen pizza and takeout are totally legit
10:02
as part of your plan.
10:03
Next, as I tell my friends at the end of dinner,
10:06
love your leftovers.
10:07
They are the only true free lunch.
10:09
And when you get sick of them, you can move on to number three,
10:13
which is freeze your food.
10:14
Your freezer is like a magic pause button,
10:16
and so many things can be frozen that you don't think of:
10:19
bread, milk, cheese
10:21
and that half jar of pasta sauce you didn't use.
10:24
Next, use it up.
10:26
In my house,
10:27
this looks like my husband eating that peanut butter and jelly sandwich
10:31
for dinner.
10:32
But for you, it might be whipping up a stir fry
10:34
with whatever veggies are wilting in your fridge.
10:37
Whatever it is,
10:38
be sure to shop your fridge before you restock it.
10:41
And lastly, learn your labels.
10:43
"Best by" and "enjoy by" are really just guesstimates of when food is at its best,
10:48
they’re not an indication that it’s gone bad.
10:51
So be sure to use your senses before you toss things.
10:54
These strategies are not Earth-shattering.
10:56
They're things that many of our parents and grandparents did.
10:59
And you can be sure that my son is learning them as well.
11:03
Because as we tackle this massive climate crisis,
11:06
reducing food waste really is the low-hanging fruit.
11:10
But no matter how sustainably we grow that fruit,
11:14
it's only a good use of resources and nutrition
11:17
if we all do our part to make sure that it actually gets eaten.
11:22
Thank you.
11:23
(Applause)
